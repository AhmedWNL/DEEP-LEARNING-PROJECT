## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-project.git
cd deep-learning-project
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

To train the model:

```bash
python src/train.py --config config.yaml
```

To run inference:

```bash
python src/predict.py --input your_input_file
```

## 🧠 Model Architecture

<!-- Describe the model architecture, number of layers, activation functions, etc. -->

The model is a \[e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer] consisting of:

* Input layer
* [x] hidden layers with ReLU activations
* Dropout for regularization
* Final softmax/sigmoid layer for prediction

## 📊 Dataset

<!-- Brief details about the dataset -->

We use the \[dataset name], which contains \[X] classes and \[N] samples. The dataset is preprocessed using normalization, resizing, and data augmentation.

## 🏋️ Training

The model is trained for **N** epochs using:

* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
* Learning Rate: 0.001
* Batch Size: 32

Training logs are saved in `outputs/logs/`.

## 📊 Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

Evaluation results are saved in `outputs/`.

## 📷 Results

<!-- Add sample outputs, charts, images, or metrics -->

Example prediction:
